## Features
- **Player vs AI Mode**: Play against an intelligent AI opponent.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
- **Simple User Interface**: Easy-to-understand console-based interface.
- **Draw Detection**: Recognizes game over conditions (Win, Lose, or Draw).
- **Efficient Coding Practices**: Designed with clean and modular code.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Algorithm**: Minimax Algorithm
- **Java Collections**: To handle board states and moves efficiently

## Game Rules
1. The game is played on a **3x3 grid**.
2. Players take turns marking cells with **X** (user) or **O** (AI).
3. The objective is to align **three marks in a row**, column, or diagonal.
4. If no moves are left and no player has won, the game ends in a **draw**.

---

## How It Works
1. The AI uses the **Minimax Algorithm** to evaluate all possible game states.
2. The algorithm recursively determines the best possible move by simulating future moves.
3. The AI aims to minimize the player's winning chances while maximizing its own.
